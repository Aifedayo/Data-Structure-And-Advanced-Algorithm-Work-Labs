## Overview
The **Data Structure and Advanced Algorithm Work Labs** repository covers essential concepts in data structures and algorithms with practical, code-based implementations. Each lab includes explanations and code for fundamental data structures like stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and advanced algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph traversal techniques.

## Features
- Implementations of foundational data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, etc.)
- Advanced algorithms including sorting, searching, and dynamic programming
- Optimized and well-documented code for each data structure and algorithm
- Practice exercises and examples for algorithm proficiency and interview prep

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aifedayo/Data-Structure-And-Advanced-Algorithm-Work-Labs.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Data-Structure-And-Advanced-Algorithm-Work-Labs
   ```

## Usage
Each folder contains implementations of specific data structures or algorithms. You can run individual files to explore how each structure or algorithm functions or use them as a reference for your projects.

Example:
```bash
python path/to/your_script.py
```

## Contents
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more
- **Algorithms**: Sorting (Quick, Merge, Heap), Searching (Binary Search, Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search), and more
- **Practice Problems**: Structured exercises to reinforce understanding and skill
